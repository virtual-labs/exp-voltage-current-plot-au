To understand the relationship between ion channel properties and the V-I curve.

To study how the V-I curves are used to estimate the reversal potential and conductance.

To understand how the parameters recorded from a voltage clamp experiment were used to formulate the kinetics of voltage activated ion channels responsible for excitation (Na+, K+, fast gates, slow gates, etc) using V-I curve.
